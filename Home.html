    <h2> Mission </h2>
    <p>Black Markat’s main goal is to reach out to those would-be cat owners to help give them homes. Cats are known to overpopulate, and we seek to reduce that. Putting our cats in homes and giving our customers free neutering services through donations and profits. We hope to reduce overpopulation by about 45%! We are not only aiming at cat owners but also people who might need the presence of a cat, being around a caring and loving animal can be a great benefit to you for mental health.</p>

    <section id="HowWeStanOut">
    <h2>How We Stand Out</h2>
    <p>The Black Markat takes what a lot of companies do such as PetSmart, vet clinics, and adoption centers into one. We can quickly set you up with your first adoption, no more going from town to town to find the best doctor when they are all in one spot. We can help you plan which cat is great for you. We can also give you a plan so even if you don’t know what to do, we can teach you.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="OurVision">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>The Black MarKat is meant to be an all-in-one service for cats. Ranging from adoption services to vets. All of your cats’ needs will be met with the website. Even if you don’t have a cat, we can still help you. Do you need volunteer hours for school? Do you have pests swarming your business and/or home? Maybe you need a cat for therapy just to help you get through that tough time. The Black Markat believes that everyone should be using cats to their biggest potential. Cats are an untapped resource we do not use enough. Due to the overpopulation of cats, we seek every cat to find a purpose.</p>
